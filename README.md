# Video-Classification-and-Captioning
Proposing an innovative video classification and captioning system with keyframe extraction and transfer learning.

### Objective:

1. Addressing the growing importance of video classification with the rise in internet usage and the adoption of deep learning models.
Innovation in Approach:

2. Proposing an innovative method for video classification and captioning by extracting keyframes and employing a transfer learning approach.

### Classification Accuracy:

1. Achieving a remarkable **98% accuracy** on the **ISRO dataset** and an impressive **99.2% on the UCF101 dataset** using the proposed algorithm.
Comparison with Traditional Approach:

2. Evaluating and demonstrating the superiority of the proposed algorithm over the conventional CNN+RNN architecture for video classification.

### Video Captioning Method:
Introducing a **DenseNet201+GRU** based encoder-decoder model for video captioning.

### Captioning Performance:
Outperforming the CNN+RNN approach, the proposed model achieves a **METEOR score of 0.29** on the **ISRO dataset** and **0.299 on the MSR-VTT dataset.**
